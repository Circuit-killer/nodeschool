Hi!

I'll be one of the mentors helping out tomorrow and I must say, I'm REALLY EXCITED!

Teaching is the best way to learn, and I love hanging out with people who are brave enough to learn new things.
So thanks!

##### Fun!

The most important thing about attending NodeSchool is to have fun.
We will have a bunch of volunteer mentors to help you through the above classes, so come ready to learn!

You are not going to be alone tomorrow in knowing nothing about Javascript or Node. And that's OK!

The earlier you can get everything installed and working the more fun we can have tomorrow.
So make sure to ask for help in the Gitter chat room if you get stuck!

And remember to bring a water bottle. Stay hydrated! :)
